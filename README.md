Dumbhouse is a repo for my home automation app. It integrates:
* zigbee2mqtt (https://zigbee2mqtt.io)
* zigbee2mqtt2flask to make Zigbee/mqtt objects available through a Flask API (https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/zigbee2mqtt2flask)
* spotipy to remote-control Spotify (https://github.com/plamere/spotipy)
* pychromecast (https://github.com/balloob/pychromecast/)
* Some other stuff I find useful

## Why?
After trying out Hassio, Home-Assistant and OpenHAB I figured I didn't like them. I'm not too keen on installing an entire OS and fiddling with yaml files for days (especially with Hassio) just to make a button play a video. What to do with all my Zigbee hardware then?
